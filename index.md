ACM TVX is the leading international conference for presentation and discussion of research into online video and TV interaction and user experience. The conference brings together international researchers and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines, ranging from human-computer interaction, multimedia engineering and design to media studies, media psychology and sociology.

TVX is the evolution of the EuroITV conference on Interactive TV, and as such is the main conference for research in this rapidly growing field.  The incorporation of TVX (formerly EuroITV) under the ACM banner, and its sponsorship by SIGCHI (ACM special interest group in computer-human interaction) has extended the international reach and significance of the event. TVX is now the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of latest research in all areas related to the architecture, design, implementation, application and evaluation of the broadcast user experience.
